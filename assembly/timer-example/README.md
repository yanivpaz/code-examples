# Timer 
The assembly demo  print userInputs number every 1 second 

## flow
The program will iterate over userInputs and print number every 1 second.

## detailed explnation 

* loop1 - check that milllisecond time was changed  . expected changes is every ~0.055 second
* loop2 - check that 18 iterations of loop1 is done. 18 * ~0.55 is one second .
